// Book Summaries
export const bookSummary: BookSummary = {
  overview: {
    title: "Understanding the ADHD Effect on Marriage",
    content: "ADHD affects approximately 4-5% of adults and creates predictable patterns in relationships that can be deeply damaging if not understood and addressed. The 'ADHD effect' describes how ADHD symptoms and the responses to them create cycles that both partners contribute to. Research shows that 58% of relationships with at least one ADHD partner are clinically dysfunctional—twice the rate of non-ADHD relationships. People with ADHD are almost twice as likely to divorce. However, with proper understanding, treatment, and strategies, couples can break these patterns and rebuild thriving relationships."
  },
  sections: [
    { id: 1, title: "The ADHD Brain: What Partners Need to Know", content: "ADHD has a biological basis involving dysregulation of the reward system, primarily dopamine. Dr. Ned Hallowell describes living with ADHD as 'driving in the rain with bad windshield wipers at 90 mph'—things are occasionally clear but most of the time everything is coming fast. People with ADHD experience only two time zones: 'now' and 'not now,' making planning and time management extremely challenging. They may have a 'race-car brain that lacks good brakes,' leading to impulsivity and difficulty stopping once started. Emotional hyper-arousal means they're easily triggered into irritability or anger over minor things. Understanding these neurological differences is the first step toward empathy and effective strategies." },
    { id: 2, title: "The Hyperfocus Courtship Trap", content: "During courtship, the ADHD partner often 'hyperfocuses' on their new love interest, showering them with attention, affection, and romantic gestures. This intense focus makes the non-ADHD partner feel like the center of the universe. However, once the relationship becomes routine and the novelty wears off, this hyperfocus typically ends abruptly. The non-ADHD partner is left wondering what happened to the attentive, romantic person they fell in love with. This shift can feel like abandonment and often marks the beginning of relationship difficulties. Understanding that this pattern is related to ADHD's need for stimulation—not a lack of love—is crucial for both partners." },
    { id: 3, title: "The Parent-Child Dynamic", content: "The most common and destructive pattern in ADHD marriages is the parent-child dynamic. One spouse (usually the non-ADHD partner) becomes almost always responsible, while the other is rarely so. The 'parent' takes on more and more household and family responsibilities, becoming resentful and exhausted. The 'child' feels controlled and criticized, retreating further. This dynamic is devastating because it's almost impossible to be sexually attracted to a parent figure. The non-ADHD spouse often describes feeling like a 'single parent' or 'household slave,' while the ADHD spouse feels like they can never do anything right. Breaking this pattern requires both partners to change: the ADHD spouse must take more responsibility while the non-ADHD spouse must become less controlling." },
    { id: 4, title: "The Non-ADHD Spouse Experience", content: "Non-ADHD spouses often experience profound loneliness, exhaustion, and self-loathing. They describe feeling like everything is 'spinning out of control'—no matter how hard they try to regain control, they feel weaker. Many fantasize about leaving, dreaming of stability, mature decision-making, and calmness. They hate who they've become: angry, nagging, controlling. The 'exhaustion factor' comes from carrying the bulk of household and family responsibilities while often working full-time. They may feel like the 'kill-joy' who's always putting a damper on fun because they're thinking of practical things. Understanding and validating these experiences is essential for healing." },
    { id: 5, title: "The ADHD Spouse Experience", content: "Virtually all people with ADHD who have marital issues feel 'different,' unloved, and unwanted. They long to be accepted as they are, in spite of their imperfections. Many hide a large amount of shame, sometimes compensating with bluster or retreat. They've often developed a 'kit of behaviors' including unhealthy coping mechanisms like lying, covering for mistakes, or deflecting blame—survival strategies from years of criticism. The 'logical' choice for someone with untreated ADHD might be to not try, to avoid risking failure. They may retreat into an 'impenetrable defensive shell' when triggered by past pain. One of their strongest emotional desires is to be loved and accepted as they are." },
    { id: 6, title: "The Six Steps to a Better Relationship", content: "Step 1: Cultivate Empathy—understand what it's like to be in your partner's shoes. Step 2: Address Obstacle Emotions—work through anger, fear, shame, and denial that block progress. Step 3: Get Treatment for Both—ADHD treatment for one partner, support for the other's depression, anxiety, or anger. Step 4: Improve Communication—practice learning conversations, validation, and verbal cues. Step 5: Set Boundaries—establish values and behaviors essential to who you want to be. Step 6: Reignite Romance—rebuild connection through new adventures, celebration, and the gift of attention." },
    { id: 7, title: "The Three-Legged Stool of Treatment", content: "Optimal ADHD treatment includes three 'legs': making physical changes (medication), making behavioral changes (habits and routines), and developing strategies for interacting with your spouse. Medication is a 'jump-start' that makes changing habits much easier by addressing brain differences, but it's not a 'magic pill' that solves everything alone. Behavioral changes must be voluntary—the harder one partner pushes, the more the other resists. The key insight is 'try differently, not harder'—create ADHD-sensitive routines that work WITH the brain, not against it. All three legs are needed for stability; removing any one makes the stool unstable." },
    { id: 8, title: "Communication Strategies That Work", content: "Effective communication in ADHD relationships requires specific strategies. Practice 'conflict intimacy'—conversations where both partners speak non-aggressively while the other listens non-defensively. Validation isn't about agreement; it's acknowledging your partner's logic is internally consistent even if you disagree. Use verbal cues—agreed-upon words to redirect escalating conversations. Schedule specific times for difficult topics to lighten the atmosphere the rest of the week. Be aware of tone—frustration and anger trigger defensive responses. Believe your partner and listen to understand their experience. The Five Core Concerns (Appreciation, Affiliation, Autonomy, Status, Role) should guide all negotiations." },
    { id: 9, title: "Setting Effective Boundaries", content: "A personal boundary is a value, characteristic, or behavior essential to living as the person you wish to be. Effective boundaries focus on people issues (respect, autonomy, values) rather than 'thing' issues. They should not be created in response to arguments or intended to punish. The ACBD rule—Always Consult Before Deciding—helps avoid autonomy conflicts. Declaring autonomy doesn't mean declaring war; you can be autonomous but connected around positive things. Boundaries protect your sense of self while respecting your partner's autonomy. They're about who you want to be, not about controlling your partner." },
    { id: 10, title: "Rebuilding Connection and Romance", content: "Research shows that doing new and exciting activities together improves feelings more than just spending time together. Celebrating successes is more powerful than showing support during difficulties. Build on ADHD's natural spontaneity to add fun and excitement. Get a babysitter often to focus on each other. Post photos of adventures together to reinforce positive memories. Put strengthening connections first, getting things done second. The gift of attention—validating your spouse by giving them focused attention—is one of the most powerful tools for rebuilding intimacy. Remember: efficiency is relatively unimportant compared to connection, except when children rely on you." },
    { id: 11, title: "The Little Voices and Past Pain", content: "Many people with ADHD have a 'little voice' suggesting they might fail. Non-ADHD partners have a similar voice whispering 'If you don't take care of this, everything will fall apart.' These voices drive destructive behaviors. When triggered by past pain, partners may retreat into defensive shells or lash out. The best defense is treating ADHD effectively and creating a safe communication environment. Acknowledge the legitimacy of past pain while recognizing that experiencing pain today doesn't mean returning to the past. You are in control of your responses now. Healing requires both partners to address their internal voices and past wounds." },
    { id: 12, title: "17 Critical Points for Success", content: "1. Eradicate the blame game. 2. Step out of the cycle of anger. 3. Reestablish connection—focus on the relationship, not just logistics. 4. Be aware of shame and fear. 5. Validate your spouse with the gift of attention. 6. Seek help from people who understand ADHD. 7. Remember that change takes time. 8. Applaud your progress. 9. Both partners need treatment. 10. The ADHD spouse must take responsibility for their symptoms. 11. The non-ADHD spouse must become less controlling. 12. Create ADHD-sensitive routines. 13. Use verbal cues for difficult conversations. 14. Schedule time for connection. 15. Celebrate successes together. 16. Respect each other's need for space. 17. Take control of ADHD together so you can thrive." }
